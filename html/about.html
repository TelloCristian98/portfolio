            My Story <strong>starts here!</strong>
          </h2>
          <p>
            I'm a web developer and software engineer from Quito, Ecuador. I
            have a passion for creating web systems and applications that
            improve people's daily lives. My specialty is in backend development
            using technologies like PHP, Laravel, NodeJS and Ajax. I also have
            extensive experience with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Currently, I'm
            expanding my frontend skills by learning ReactJS. As a software
            engineering student at Universidad de las Fuerzas Armadas ESPE, I've
            worked on projects like updating my university's website using
            WordPress.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm also a research assistant in the computer science department. In
            addition to software engineering, I have two years of experience
            studying electronic engineering and enjoy working on IoT projects. I
            also completed an intensive ESL program at Atlantic Cape Community
            College in the US, so I'm a certified fluent English speaker and
            writer. My goal is to continue growing as a developer and building
            innovative solutions that make a difference.
          </p>
          <p>
            In my free time, I love staying active by playing soccer every
            weekend and going to the gym during the weekdays. I also play guitar
            in a rock-pop band, which allows me to pursue my musical passions.
